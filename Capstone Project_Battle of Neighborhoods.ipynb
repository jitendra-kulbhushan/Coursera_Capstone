The city is divided in mainly **Four Zones** i.e \n  1. Chennai North\n  2. Chennai South\n  3. Chennai West\n  4. Chennai East \n  \n\nThese zones are further divided in several neighbourhoods. All these neighbourhoods have different housing rates and different amenities for public utilisation.\\\nFor anyone new to the city it gets challenging to find a neighbourhood of choice given the variation in housing rates and the available amenities."

The link here will be used to get the information of housing rates of various housing socities rate. **[Data for Housing Socities Rate][1]**. This will contain data of several housing societies and the range of prices for same.\n  2. The link here will be used to get the geo cordinates for various neighbourhoods. **[Data for Neighbourhood coordinates][2]**. This data will have the ge coordinates of neighbourhoods.\n  3. I will use the **Foursquare API** to get the neighbourhood venues for these neighbourhoods.\n  \n[1]: https://www.99acres.com/property-rates-and-price-trends-in-societies-in-chennai\n[2]: https://github.com/yankarto/Chennai_neighborhood_coordinates/blob/06a39db571b019e80502d906c8095e18a7a9d475/Chennai_neighbourhood_coordintes.csv\n\nThere are going to be some challenges about the how the extensive data is available.\\\nFor example, the [csv file][2] does not have geo coordinates for all the neighbourhoods and **Foursquare.com** does not have very extensive list of venues of these neighbourhoods.\n"

I will utilise **BeautifulSoup** library to extract relevant information for housing societies rate from [here][1].\n2. Then I will use **Pandas** library to process the data to create a dataframe that has neighbourhood name with average housing rates.\n3. The **[csv file][2]** will be utilised to get the geo coordinates for the neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods for which geo coordinates will not be available, migh have to be removed from dataframe.\n4. The **Foursquare API** will be utilised to get the top venues for these neighbourhoods.\n5. **K-Means** library and algorithm will be utilised to cluster these neighbourhoods based on top venues and average rate of housing.\n6. **Folium** library will be utilised to create a map of Chennai with marker of clustered neighbourhoods.\n\nThis is the initial methodology defined on how the data will be processed to arrive at conclusion. Depending on the data quality there can be minor changes on the methodology deployed.\n\n[1]: https://www.99acres.com/property-rates-and-price-trends-in-societies-in-chennai\n[2]: https://github.com/yankarto/Chennai_neighborhood_coordinates/blob/06a39db571b019e80502d906c8095e18a7a9d475/Chennai_neighbourhood_coordintes.csv\n"
